#This is a simple implementation of Rosenblatt's perceptron classification model in python applied on the iris-dataset, 
the file animated_perceptron.py builds on top of the model to give us a visualization of the learning process by plotting the seperation line with each iteration in a 2d space.

Required libraries for this project are:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - random
  - pandas
  
You can find the article for this project where I go into details of the implementation here:
